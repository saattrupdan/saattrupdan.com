      Senior AI Specialist with highly specialised knowledge of machine learning methods.
      My PhD in Mathematics has given me the technical knowledge to tweak and invent
      novel machine learning algorithms to solve new problems, and my industrial
      experience has given me the skills to implement these algorithms in
      production-level code. My primary research interests are within natural language
      processing and graph machine learning.
