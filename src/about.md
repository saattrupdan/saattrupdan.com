Welcome to my website! ðŸ‘‹

I'm currently working at the Alexandra Institute as a Senior AI Specialist,
where I'm spending half my time conducting research and the other half
helping out Danish companies with their machine learning needs.

I have an academic background, with a Ph.D. in Mathematics and a Postdoc in
Machine Learning, and also several years of industry experience in the public
and private sector.

I'm really interested in low-resource natural language processing
(especially for Scandinavian languages), bias in language models, uncertainty
estimation methods, and graph machine learning.
