So far we've characterised the scaled pointclasses among the projective hierarchy as
well as establishing Steel's result that $\Sigma\_1^{J_\alpha(\mathbb R)}$ is scaled
for all $\alpha>0$ such that $\text{Det}(J_\alpha(\mathbb R)$. We now move on to
boldface territory, finishing off this series on scales.

This post is part of a series on scales:

4. Scales 101 - Part IV: Leaving a Gap

We're going to need the notion of a gap, where we say that an interval $[\alpha,\beta]$
is a gap if $J_\alpha(\mathbb R)\prec\_1^{\mathbb R} J_\beta(\mathbb R)$ and this stops
being the case when we extend the interval. Here $\prec\_1^{\mathbb R}$ means that the
left-hand side is a $\Sigma\_1$-elementary substructure with parameters allowed from
$\mathbb R\cup\\{V_{\omega+1}\\}$. This is also sometimes called a $\Sigma\_1$-gap, but
since we're not going to need the $\Sigma\_n$-gaps for anything we stick to the 'gap'
terminology.

For convenience we also say that $[(\bf\delta^2\_1)^{L(\mathbb R)},\Theta^{L(\mathbb
R)}]$ is a gap, where we note that $(\bf\delta^2\_1)^{L(\mathbb R)}$ is least such that
$J_{(\bf\delta^2\_1)^{L(\mathbb R)}}(\mathbb R)\prec\_1^{\mathbb R} L(\mathbb R)$. Our
first lemma states that gaps can be used to characterise ordinals.

> **Lemma.** The gaps partition the ordinals below $\Theta^{L(\mathbb R)}$.

**Proof**. Let $\gamma<\Theta^{L(\mathbb R)}$ and let $\alpha\leq\gamma$ be least such
that $J_\alpha(\mathbb R)\prec\_1^{\mathbb R}J_\gamma(\mathbb R)$ and $\beta\geq\alpha$
the supremum of all $\delta<\Theta^{L(\mathbb R)}$ such that $J_\gamma(\mathbb
R)\prec\_1^{\mathbb R}J_\delta(\mathbb R)$. Then $[\alpha,\beta]$ is clearly a gap with
$\gamma\in[\alpha,\beta]$.

Now say that two gaps $[\alpha,\beta]$ and $[\alpha',\beta']$ overlapped at some
$\gamma$. This means that $J_\alpha(\mathbb R)\prec\_1^{\mathbb R}J_\gamma(\mathbb R)$
and $J_\gamma(\mathbb R)\prec\_1^{\mathbb R}J_{\beta'}(\mathbb R)$ but
$J_\alpha(\mathbb R)\not\prec\_1^{\mathbb R}J_{\beta'}(\mathbb R)$. But this is
impossible as we're requiring that all parameters lie in $\mathbb
R\cup\\{V_{\omega+1}\\}$. **QED**

We can thus split an arbitrary $\alpha<\Theta^{L(\mathbb R)}$ into three cases:

1. $\alpha$ begins a gap;
2. $\alpha$ ends a gap;
3. $\alpha$ lies properly within a gap.

When it comes to finding scaled pointclasses, the following result shows that we can
disregard the third possibility.

We thus only have to analyse case 1 and 2. Let's start off with the first case where
$\alpha$ begins a gap. Again we may assume $\alpha>0$, since we already covered the
$\alpha=0$ case. The case where $n=1$ turns out to just be a corollary of the lightface
result that we covered last time.

> **Corollary.** If $\alpha>0$ begins a gap and $\text{Det}(J_\alpha(\mathbb R))$ holds
> then $\bf\Sigma\_1^{J_\alpha(\mathbb R)}$ has the scale property.

**Proof**. Note that since $\alpha$ begins a gap there's a partial
$\bf\Sigma\_1^{J_\alpha(\mathbb R)}$ surjection $\mathbb R\to J_\alpha(\mathbb R)$.
Indeed, by forming the hull $H:=\text{cHull}_1^{J_\alpha(\mathbb R)}(\mathbb
R\cup\\{V_{\omega+1}\\})$ we see that $H=J_\alpha(\mathbb R)$ by condensation and
minimality, as $\alpha$ begins a gap, so the associated $\bf\Sigma\_1^{J_\alpha(\mathbb
R)}$ Skolem function is then as desired. Steel's lightface result then gives the
desired scale. **QED**

When we move to $n>1$ then the existence of scales turn out to depend on
the admissibility of $\alpha$, where we say that $\alpha$ is admissible if
$J_\alpha(\mathbb R)\models\textsf{KP}$, or equivalently that there's no
$\Sigma\_1^{J_\alpha(\mathbb R)}$ cofinal map $\gamma\to\omega\alpha$ for some
$\gamma<\omega\alpha$. Technically speaking the terminology admissible is reserved for
the $L$-hierarchy, so we could've called it something like $\mathbb R$-admissible --
but as we won't need to consider the $L$-variants of admissibility, there won't be any
confusion. Now, the key lemma is the following.

> **Lemma.** Assume that $\alpha$ begins a gap and is inadmissible (not admissible).
> Then for all $n\geq 1$,
>
> $$
> \bf\Sigma_{n+1}^{J_\alpha(\mathbb R)}=\exists^{\mathbb R}\bf\Pi\_n^{J_\alpha(\mathbb
> R)}\text{ and }\bf\Pi_{n+1}^{J_\alpha(\mathbb R)}=\forall^{\mathbb
> R}\bf\Sigma\_n^{J_\alpha(\mathbb R)}.
> $$

I won't give the proof here (a full proof can be found in my note), but the idea is
that the conjunction of $\alpha$ beginning a gap and being inadmissible implies that we
get a cofinal map $\mathbb R\to\omega\alpha$. The above two results then give us that
$\bf\Sigma_{2n+1}^{J_\alpha(\mathbb R)}$ and $\bf\Pi_{2n+2}^{J_\alpha(\mathbb R)}$ have
the scale property, whenever $\alpha>0$ begins a gap, is inadmissible,
$\text{Det}(J_{\alpha+1}(\mathbb R))$ holds and $n<\omega$. To see that inadmissibility
is necessary, Martin comes to the rescue again.

**Theorem (Martin).** Assume $\alpha$ begins a gap, is admissible and
$\text{Det}(J_{\alpha+1}(\mathbb R))$ holds. Then there's a $\Pi\_1^{J_\alpha(\mathbb
R)}$ subset of $\mathbb R\times\mathbb R$ with no uniformisation in
$J_{\alpha+1}(\mathbb R)$. In particular, none of the classes
$\bf\Sigma\_n^{J_\alpha(\mathbb R)}$ or $\bf\Pi\_n^{J_\alpha(\mathbb R)}$ are scaled for
$n>1$.

This finishes the case where $\alpha$ begins a gap. We'll need a definition for the gap
endings. We say that a gap $[\alpha,\beta]$ is strong if for every $b\in
J_\beta(\mathbb R)$ there's a $\gamma<\beta$ and an $a\in J_\gamma(\mathbb R)$ such
that for every $\varphi(v)\in\Sigma\_1\cup\Pi\_1$ it holds that

$$
J_\gamma(\mathbb R)\models\varphi[a]\text{ iff }J_\beta(\mathbb R)\models\varphi[b].
$$

It turns out that for us to have any chance of finding scales at the end of gaps, we
have to require our gaps to be weak. Martin returns with a counterexample.

> **Theorem (Martin).** Let $[\alpha,\beta]$ be a strong gap and assume
> $\text{Det}(J_{\alpha+1}(\mathbb R))$. Then there's a $\Pi\_1^{J_\alpha(\mathbb R)}$

So we can focus solely on weak gaps then. Furthermore, if $\rho\_k(J_\beta(\mathbb
R))\neq\mathbb R$ (i.e. we're not projecting to 0) for every $k\leq n$ then we don't
get any new subsets of reals of interest, meaning that

$$
\bf\Sigma\_n^{J_\beta(\mathbb R)}=\bf\Sigma\_n^{J_\alpha(\mathbb R)}\text{ and }
\bf\Pi\_n^{J_\beta(\mathbb R)}=\bf\Pi\_n^{J_\alpha(\mathbb R)},
$$

just reducing it to the begins-a-gap case. Taking this into account, we do have the
following theorem, whose proof is a technical tour de force based on the same ideas as
the lightface proof that I've written up here.

> **Theorem (Steel).** Let $[\alpha,\beta]$ be a weak gap and assume
> $\text{Det}(J_{\alpha+1}(\mathbb R))$. If $n<\omega$ is least such that
> $\rho\_n(J_\beta(\mathbb R))=\mathbb R$ then

$$
\bf\Sigma_{n+2k}^{J_\beta(\mathbb R)}\text{ and }\bf\Pi_{n+2k+1}^{J_\beta(\mathbb R)}
$$

are scaled, for every $k<\omega$.

Aaaand that finishes the complete characterisation, which is used to organise the cases
in the core model induction. So if you're ever wondering if
$\bf\Sigma\_n^{J_\alpha(\mathbb R)}$ is scaled, we can now use the following handy
