As ChatGPT and GPT4 has gained enormous popularity, open source versions of these
generative language models have started to emerge. This is not anything new: We saw the
exact same thing happen when proprietary text-to-image models
[DALL-E](https://openai.com/product/dall-e-2) and
[Midjourney](https://www.midjourney.com/) was (essentially) replaced when the open
source model [Stable
Diffusion](https://huggingface.co/stabilityai/stable-diffusion-2-1) came out.

But the open source options within generative language models have exploded recently,
so this post is meant as an overview of the models that have been released so far. This
is advancing at a rapid pace however, so I'm sure this will be somewhat outdated in a
couple of months, but let's see!

All of these models are roughly following the same recipe:

1. They start with a generative language model M;
2. They finetune M on an instruction dataset D;
3. (optional) They train a reward model and tune M further using this model in an RLHF
   setting.

Thus, in order to get a grasp over the different kinds of models available, we really
need to cover the options of M and D. Curiously, none of the open source models apply
the third RLHF step, in contrast with ChatGPT.


### Generative Language Models

Within the space of open source dialogue systems, these are currently all based on a
handful of different generative language models. Let's break them down one at a time.

#### From Tsinghua University: `GLM`
GLM, or **G**eneral **L**anguage **M**odel, is a language model introduced in [this
paper](http://dx.doi.org/10.18653/v1/2022.acl-long.26) by Tsinghua University,
published at ACL 2022, and a larger 130B version was published at ICLR 2023 in [this
paper](https://doi.org/10.48550/arXiv.2210.02414).

Where there is normally a clear difference between how we train encoder models such as
BERT, decoder models such as GPT, and encoder-decoder models such as T5, GLM is trained
in a way that makes it proficient in both Natural Language Understanding as well as
generative tasks. This is done by essentially combining the T5 objective of span
corruption with the GPT objective of next token prediction, by masking out spans of
tokens and re-constructing them in an autoregressive fashion. They claim that their
130B model beats GPT-3 and PaLM.

They have released [a 10B English GLM model](https://huggingface.co/THUDM/glm-10b)
pretrained on [EleutherAI's Pile
Dataset](https://huggingface.co/datasets/EleutherAI/the_pile) and [a 10B Chinese GLM
model](https://huggingface.co/THUDM/glm-10b-chinese) pretrained on the
[WuDaoCorpora](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.aiopen.2021.06.001). To get access to their
130B model, you have to fill in [this Google
form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSehr5Dh_i3TwACmFFi8QEgIVNYGmSPwV0GueIcsUev0NEfUug/viewform).
They have released their models under a [custom non-commercial
license](https://github.com/THUDM/GLM-130B/blob/main/MODEL_LICENSE).

#### From Meta: `LLaMA`
LLaMA, or **L**arge **La**nguage Model **M**eta **A**I, is a collection of models
released by Meta AI and introduced in [this preprint
paper](https://doi.org/10.48550/arXiv.2302.13971) in February 2023. There is not much
novel about these models, aside from having been trained on purely openly available
data, and released in a range of smaller model sizes, down to 7B parameters. They claim
that their 13B parameter LLaMA model beats GPT-3 on most benchmarks, and that their
largest model, with 65B parameters, is competitive with Deepmind's
[Chinchilla-70B](https://doi.org/10.48550/arXiv.2203.15556) and Google's
[PaLM-540B](https://doi.org/10.48550/arXiv.2204.02311) models.

The models have been trained on crawled web data, Github, Wikipedia, Books, ArXiv and
StackExchange. To access the models you have to fill in [this Google
form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfqNECQnMkycAp2jP4Z9TFX0cGR4uf7b_fBxjY_OjhJILlKGA/viewform),
although [unofficial leaked versions](https://huggingface.co/models?search=llama) have
been released.

#### From Google: `FLaN-T5`
T5 is an encoder-decoder model released by Google in [this JMLR 2020
paper](https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-031-27181-6_5), and this model was further
improved using Google's FLaN (**F**inetuning **La**nguage **M**odels) method in [this
paper](https://doi.org/10.48550/arXiv.2210.11416), which is basically finetuning the
models on many (~2000) tasks, improving their zero-shot capabilities.

The FLaN-T5 models have been released [in various
sizes](https://huggingface.co/models?sort=downloads&search=flan-t5), from 80M to 11B
parameters, all under the permissive Apache 2.0 license, which permits commercial
usage.

#### From EleutherAI: `GPT-J`, `GPT-neoX` and `Pythia`
Lastly, the non-profit research lab [EleutherAI](https://www.eleuther.ai/) continues to
release new open source models. All of the models have been released with the Apache
2.0 license and can thus be used for commercial purposes.

The first one we'll cover here is GPT-J, which is a generative language model with 6B
parameters released in 2021. It was trained on the Pile, and they claim that it is on
par with the 6.7B version of GPT-3. This model can be found
[here](https://huggingface.co/EleutherAI/gpt-j-6b).

A newer model released by EleutherAI is the GPT-neoX model, which was published in
[this paper](http://dx.doi.org/10.18653/v1/2022.bigscience-1.9) from the Big Science
Workshop in 2022. This model has 20B parameters and was also trained on the Pile. They
claim that this model beats GPT-3 Curie, while still being slightly worse than GPT-3
DaVinci. They've released the model on Hugging Face
[here](https://huggingface.co/EleutherAI/gpt-neox-20b).

Lastly, EleutherAI have also released their Pythia models on April 3, 2023, in [this
preprint paper](https://doi.org/10.48550/arXiv.2304.01373). These models vary from 70M
to 12B parameters and roughly match the performance
[OPT](https://doi.org/10.48550/arXiv.2205.01068) and
[BLOOM](https://doi.org/10.48550/arXiv.2211.05100) of similar model sizes. The models
can be found
[here](https://huggingface.co/models?sort=downloads&search=eleutherai%2Fpythia).

#### From BlinkDL: `RWKV`
A community of developers have trained the `RWKV` models, being generative models which
are **not** transformers! Instead, these are RNNs which they claim have the same
performance as transformers. These models have all been trained on the Pile. The models
can be found on the Hugging Face Hub
[here](https://huggingface.co/models?search=blinkdl/rwkv).

#### From Writer: `Palmyra`
Writer has trained a decoder model on a custom dataset that seems to be a subset of
CommonCrawl. This model has been released under the Apache 2.0 license and can thus be
used for commercial purposes. You can find it on the Hugging Face Hub
[here](https://huggingface.co/Writer/palmyra-base).

#### From Stability AI: `StableLM`
Stability AI, the company behind Stable Diffusion, released their first version of
their StableLM model. This is based on the `GPT-neoX` architecture, has been trained on
The Pile and released under the CC-BY-SA license, permitting commercial use. It is
available in [this Hugging Face Hub
repo](https://huggingface.co/stabilityai/stablelm-base-alpha-7b).

#### From Together Computer: `INCITE`
Together Computer has, together with Ontocord.ai, ETH DS3Lab, AAI CERC, Université de
Montréal, MILA - Québec AI Institute, Stanford Center for Research on Foundation Models
(CRFM), Stanford Hazy Research research group and LAION, built a massive dataset,
called `RedPajama`, that imitates the training dataset of Meta's LLaMA model, to be
able to train a fully open source version of LLaMA that can be used for commercial use.
[The dataset can be downloaded
here](https://huggingface.co/datasets/togethercomputer/RedPajama-Data-1T). They further
trained a decoder-style language model on this dataset, called `INCITE`, and [this
language model can be found
here](https://huggingface.co/togethercomputer/RedPajama-INCITE-Base-7B-v0.1). They
claim that [the model performs better than the `Pythia` and `GPT-J` models, but that it
is still not quite as good as LLaMA
yet](https://www.together.xyz/blog/redpajama-models-v1). The model has been released
under the Apache 2.0 license, thus permitting commercial use. Note that their model is
still undergoing training, so a better version should be released soon.

#### From Mosaic ML: `MPT`
Mosaic ML has trained and released their **M**osaic **P**retrained **T**ransformer
model, which has been trained on 1T tokens of English text and code, two thirds of
which come from the C4 and mC4 datasets, and roughly 17 per cent from the RedPajama
dataset. [See the full dataset breakdown in their blog
post](https://www.mosaicml.com/blog/mpt-7b). [They claim that this model performs on
par with LLaMA](https://www.mosaicml.com/blog/mpt-7b). [The model has been released
under the Apache 2.0 license here](https://huggingface.co/mosaicml/mpt-7b).

#### From Berkeley AI Research: `OpenLLaMA`
Researchers from Berkeley have also trained an open copy of LLaMA trained on the
`RedPajama` dataset. In other words, exactly like `INCITE`. Just like with `INCITE`,
they are still in the process of training the model, but have [released a 300B data
checkpoint](https://huggingface.co/openlm-research/open_llama_7b_preview_300bt).


### Instruction Datasets

The generative model was the first ingredient to the dialogue systems out there, with
the second one being the instruction dataset they were finetuned on. Just like with the
models, we'll cover most of the datasets used today.

#### Derived from OpenAI Models: `Alpaca`, `CodeAlpaca`, `SOGPT`, `ShareGPT`, `HC3`, `WebGPT`, `SummGPT`, `Guanaco` and `EvolInstruct`
These datasets have all been created using the outputs from the OpenAI models, in one
way or another. Crucially, this means that [they cannot be used to create competing
models to the OpenAI ones](https://openai.com/policies/terms-of-use).

The first one, `Alpaca`, was released by Stanford University in March 2023 as the
training dataset of their `Alpaca` model. They did this by first creating a small
dataset of 175 instruction prompts, and then using GPT-3.5 to use this dataset to
generate 52,000 diverse prompts, along with answers to them. They have [released the
dataset in their Github
repo](https://github.com/tatsu-lab/stanford_alpaca#data-release).

`CodeAlpaca` is a variant of `Alpaca` containing source code, created by Sahil
Chaudhary and also released in March 2023, and was generated in the same manner as
`Alpaca`. The dataset contains 20,000 samples and can be found
[here](https://github.com/sahil280114/codealpaca#data-release).

`SOGPT` (**S**tack**O**verflow **GPT**) starts with the [StackOverflow Questions
dataset](https://huggingface.co/datasets/pacovaldez/stackoverflow-questions), which
consists of 1.5M code-related questions from the
[StackOverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/) Q&A website. Nomic AI deduplicated the
dataset, took a random sample of this dataset and generated answers to the questions
from GPT-3.5-turbo. This dataset [has been released on the Hugging Face
Hub](https://huggingface.co/datasets/nomic-ai/gpt4all_prompt_generations).

`ShareGPT` is a dataset of prompts and answers from the ChatGPT models, scraped from
the [ShareGPT website](https://sharegpt.com/). There have been [several scraped
datasets released](https://huggingface.co/datasets?search=sharegpt).

`HC3` was created by a group of researchers from 6 different universities, being a
dataset that allows one to compare human responses with responses from ChatGPT. There
are roughly 24,000 samples in the dataset, and it has been released on the Hugging Face
Hub [here](https://huggingface.co/datasets/Hello-SimpleAI/HC3).

`WebGPT` and `SummGPT` have both been released by OpenAI, where `WebGPT` consists of
20,000 samples that were used to train a reward model for long form question answering.
`SummGPT` was trained with the same purpose, albeit for a summarization model. `WebGPT`
can be found in [this Hugging Face
repo](https://huggingface.co/datasets/openai/webgpt_comparisons) and `SummGPT` in [this
one](https://huggingface.co/datasets/openai/summarize_from_feedback).

`Guanaco` was built using a similar method to `Alpaca`. They start with the same 175
dataset of instruction prompts, translate these to Japanese and Chinese, and generate a
total of ~500K samples, containing answers from GPT-3.5. This dataset is released with
the GPL 3.0 copyleft license, meaning that commercial use is allowed but only if the
commercial use is open source. It can be downloaded at [this Hugging Face
repo](https://huggingface.co/datasets/JosephusCheung/GuanacoDataset).

`EvolInstruct` is a method similar to `Alpaca`, where GPT-3.5 was used to generate
instructions and answers based on a seed set. The difference here is that they do it in
stages, where each "evolution" is gradually more difficult. The result is a dataset
that has a more even distribution in difficulty, compared to others that have an
overrepresentation of the easy instructions. This dataset was produced by Microsoft and
can be found [here](https://huggingface.co/datasets/victor123/evol_instruct_70k).

#### From LAION: `OIG`, `OASST1`
The **O**pen **I**nstruction **G**eneralist dataset (`OIG`) was released by LAION in
March 2023 and consists of a large collection of datasets that can be used for
instruction tuning, such as question answering datasets. The licenses for these
datasets vary, but all of them are permissive and can be used for commercial purposes
(e.g., Apache 2.0, CC-BY-SA). There are currently 44M (!) samples in the dataset, and
the dataset can be found [here](https://huggingface.co/datasets/laion/OIG).

LAION also released the `OASST1` in April 2023 as part of [the crowd-sourced Open
Assistant project](https://open-assistant.io/) and consists of 161K conversations
between human volunteers. This dataset has been released
[here](https://huggingface.co/datasets/OpenAssistant/oasst1) under the Apache 2.0
license and can thus be used for commercial purposes.

#### From Anthropic: `HH`
The **H**elpfulness and **H**armlessness dataset (`HH`) was released by Anthropic in
December 2022 and consists of 161K pairs of conversations that have been evaluated by
humans, for use in reward modelling. All of the conversations and evaluations were
conducted by master-qualified crowd workers from the US, using Amazon Mechanical Turk.
The dataset has been released
[here](https://huggingface.co/datasets/Anthropic/hh-rlhf), but there does not seem to
be any license for the data (only an MIT license for the code), so I would guess that
all rights have been reserved by Anthropic, thus not allowing commercial use.

#### From Stanford University: `SHP`
The **S**tanford **H**uman **P**references (`SHP`) is a dataset of 385K collective
human preferences over responses to questions/instructions in 18 different subject
areas, from cooking to legal advice. This dataset is meant for training reward models
for the RLHF step of the training. [The license is a bit mysterious,
however](https://huggingface.co/datasets/stanfordnlp/SHP#license).

#### From Databricks: `Dolly`
Databricks released their `Dolly` dataset in April 2023 as part of their model with the
same name. This dataset consists of 15K samples, all written by thousands of employees
at Databricks. The dataset can be found
[here](https://github.com/databrickslabs/dolly/tree/master/data) and has been released
under the CC-BY-SA license, permitting commercial use.

#### From OpenAI: `GSM8K`
**G**rade **S**school **M**ath 8K (GSM8K) is a dataset containing 8.5K grade school
math word problems, written manually by humans. It was released by OpenAI in November
2021. The [repository containing the dataset](https://github.com/openai/grade-school-math/tree/master)
has been released under the MIT license, which technically speaking only gives
permissions to the source code and not the data itself, not permitting any commercial
use of the dataset. The dataset can be found on the Hugging Face Hub
[here](https://huggingface.co/datasets/gsm8k).

#### From BigScience: `P3`
`P3`, or the **P**ublic **P**ool of **P**rompts, is similar to LAION's `OIG` dataset,
in that it consists of many other datasets with permissive licenses, uniformised and
combined into a single dataset. Some examples of the types of datasets include question
answering datasets, text classification datasets and natural language inference
datasets. [See the full list of datasets included
here](https://huggingface.co/datasets/bigscience/P3#source-data), and [the final `P3`
dataset can be found here](https://huggingface.co/datasets/bigscience/P3). This dataset
was released in 2021 under the Apache 2.0 license, permitting commercial use.

#### From Allen Institute for AI: `NI`
The **N**atural **I**nstructions dataset is again similar to both `OIG` and `P3`, being
a collection of existing datasets with permissive licenses. It was released in 2022
under the Apache 2.0 license, permitting commercial use. [The dataset can be found
here](https://github.com/allenai/natural-instructions), and [an unofficial preprocessed
version can be found
here](https://huggingface.co/datasets/Muennighoff/natural-instructions).

Note that many of the models can't be used for commercial purposes, either because
they're based on `LLaMA`, or that they use an instruction dataset derived from the
OpenAI models.

The models allowed for commercial purposes are:

- OpenAssistant-1-Pythia
- OpenChatKit
- Camel
- Dolly-2
- h2oGPT-Pythia
- h2oGPT-neoX
- INCITE-Chat
- INCITE-Instruct
- MPT-Instruct

An evaluation have been conducted by Nomic AI of _some_ of these models in [their
report](https://static.nomic.ai/gpt4all/2023_GPT4All-J_Technical_Report_2.pdf):

<center>
  <img src="/src/assets/img/open-source-gai-model-evaluation.webp" class="invert-on-darkmode" alt="Table with open source dialogue system evaluations">
</center>

Further, we can compare some of these models with existing models, using Stanford
University's [HELM
benchmark](https://crfm.stanford.edu/helm/latest/?group=core_scenarios), where I've
included evaluations of `Pythia`, `LLaMA` and the `INCITE` models, [conducted by
Together Computer](https://www.together.xyz/blog/redpajama-models-v1):

<center>
  <img src="/src/assets/img/mean-helm-score.webp" class="invert-on-darkmode" alt="Plot of mean HELM scores of generative models">
</center>

As we can see, the open source models are starting to catch up with the established
models from OpenAI. Note that neither GPT3.5-turbo nor GPT-4 are included here,
however, which [seem to be much better than
GPT3](https://doi.org/10.48550/arXiv.2303.08774). Furthermore, as many of the models
included in this blog post are not included in these evaluations, I'll be conducting my
own small qualitative evaluation in the next section.


### Generating Some Poetry

As we don't yet have any systematic evaluation results for all of the models yet, I'll
be prompting them with two prompts here, just to get a feel for them. The first one is
an instruction:

> Can you write a poem about how dialogue models will take over the world?

The follow-up prompt will be the following:

> Can you write it in the style of an 8-year old?

Note that I only prompted the dialogue systems having a working online demo (many of
the unofficial demos on Hugging Face timed out).
